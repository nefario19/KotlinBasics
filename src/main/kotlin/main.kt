    Challenge 4: Use string interpolation

    Taif like to cook in the weekends. In the morning he usually uses 2 eggs.
    After whisking the eggs he then uses 1 teaspoon sumac and 1.5 teaspoons salt.
    Those are mixed with the eggs and then 3 teaspoons of black pepper are thrown
    in the mix. Cooking that in an ordinary frying pan for 5 minutes results in a
    great omelette.

    - The text below has some information in them that can be extracted
    and printed using string interpolation.
    - Print three sentences using string interpolation and information in the
    above anecdote.

    Challenge hint: Search the internet for Kotlin string interpolation and
    you'll find many examples. Also start making variables to store the information.

    Challenge 6:

    Create a Kotlin switch case. Read the following anecdote.

    When driving in an urban area, the maximum speed is 50 km/h.
    When driving under 50 km/h that means you're driving slow.
    When driving faster than 50 km/h you're driving too fast.

    Write a switch case with three cases.
    One case when you're driving exactly 50 prints a motivating line such as "great job!"
    One case when you're driving to slow that prints something like "you should a little faster"
    One case when you're driving to fast that prints a line that says that you should slow down.

    You can make up your own lines.

    Bonus round:

    Take a look at challenge 6. Adjust the code that when you're driving too slow or too fast,
    it prints how much faster or slower you have to go to reach 50 km/h.
